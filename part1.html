    <h1>Page Designs</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>For my assignment, I decide to redesign the Lets Talk Science. Because the information is too overwhelming, I think a splash page can filter all the inforamtion for the audience. This is also the reason why I decided to have navigation menu on my splash so it would be convienient for audinence to navigate through the website.</p>
    
    <div>
        <img src="splash.JPG" alt="page design for splash page of the let'ts talk science" width="500"/>
    </div>
    <p>I decide on this desgin for the following reasions regarding to the 4 design principles</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proximity</strong> I choose to keep the navigation links group together as part of the header which is easy for audience to choose between them </li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong> In the header, the logo should aligned to the left and the navigation menu items should algined to the right so it will give the page more of sense of wide spaces. I want to avoid making the webpage being crowded.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetation</strong> I decide to use a title text on the image with the colors that are used for the logo. I also decide to use similar images for the 2 pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong> Using the dark image as background and the light and bright navigation header and footer will draw users attention to the centre of the page. </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I decided to redesign the <em>Get Involved</em> page. I like the idea of providing the links to other parts of page so audience can reach to the information faster. However, the page is too complicated and flooded with uncessary information and logo. 
    </p>
    
    <div>
        <img src="getinvolved.JPG" alt="diagram for getinvolved" width ="500" />
    </div>
    
        <p>I decide on this desgin for the following reasions regarding to the 4 design principles</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proximity</strong> As mention abovedI choose to keep the navigation links group together as part of the header which is easy for audience to choose between them </li>
        <li><strong>Alignment</strong> In the header, the logo should aligned to the left and the navigation menu items should algined to the right so it will give the page more of spreading out. I want to avoid making the webpage being crowded. the image should be aligned to the logo. </li>
        <li><strong>Repetation</strong> I decide to use a title text on the image with the colors that are used for the logo. The use of the image as background again will help the pages being more consistent and the audience will feel more familiar. </li>
        <li><strong>Contrast</strong> As mentioned, using the dark image as background and the light and bright navigation header and footer will draw users attention to the centre of the page. The text area above should have dark background with white text to draw attention</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The Implementation</h1>
    
    <h2>Splash Page</h2>
    
    <p>All the images used for my assignment are the sample photos downloaded from stock.adobe.com </p>
    <p>The fonts are downloaded from www.1001freefonts.com</p>
    
    <p>The splash page was bit tricky since I needed to have the image to cover whole page. without leaving any blank. After trying using background image and other settings and research online, I decide to use image with media query. In the end, the result is great with  wide page window width.</p>
    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>The content of the page is replica of the original page. credit to http://outreach.letstalkscience.ca/sfu/get-involved.html.</p>
    
    <p>I like the idea of the image background and I decide to use those images as deviders for the content and the images create a flow for the page.</p>
    <p>I also ground all the content of the page to the middle so it is easier for reader to focus on the content. I feel that if the content is too spread out , readers might loose their focus.</p>
    <p>I also create links to the element on the same page for users' convience. Furthermore, I also create link as block on the image as button to access other parts of website. I decided to play with the blackground color and transparency for user interaction for the link. </p>
    
    <p>In the end of this assignment, I realized certain positon declaration is not working properly. but I am too tired to fix them. Thankfully, using relative and fixed position resoluve the problem. </p>
